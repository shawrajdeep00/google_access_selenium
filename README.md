# Google Access Selenium

This repository contains a basic Selenium automation script that allows users to access Google services and perform automated tasks. The script is written in Python and utilizes the Chrome WebDriver for browser automation.

## Contents

- `google_access_selenium.py`: The main Python script for automating Google access using Selenium.
- `chromedriver.exe`: The Chrome WebDriver executable required for Selenium to interact with the Chrome browser.
- `screen_record_output.webm`: A screen recording demonstrating the script in action.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the script, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Selenium (`pip install selenium`)
- Google Chrome browser

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/google_access_selenium.git
    cd google_access_selenium
    ```

2. **Install Selenium**:
    ```bash
    pip install selenium
    ```

3. **Download ChromeDriver**:
    Ensure you have the `chromedriver.exe` file in your project directory. You can download the latest version of ChromeDriver from [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads).

4. **Update the PATH (if necessary)**:
    If `chromedriver.exe` is not in your project directory, ensure that its location is included in your system's PATH environment variable.

## Usage

To run the script, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python google_access_selenium.py
```

The script will launch a Chrome browser window and perform the automated tasks as defined in the `google_access_selenium.py` file.

## Script Details

### `google_access_selenium.py`

This script contains the following functionalities:

- **Setup and Initialization**: Initializes the Selenium WebDriver and opens the Google homepage.
- **Login Automation**: Automates the login process using provided credentials.
- **Navigation and Task Execution**: Navigates to specific Google services and performs predefined tasks.

#### Example

Here's a basic example of what the script does:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys

# Initialize the Chrome WebDriver
driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path='path/to/chromedriver.exe')

# Open Google homepage
driver.get("https://www.google.com")

# Perform automated tasks (e.g., search for a query)
search_box = driver.find_element_by_name("q")
search_box.send_keys("Selenium Python")
search_box.send_keys(Keys.RETURN)

# Additional automation steps...

# Close the browser
driver.quit()
```

## Screen Recording

The `screen_record_output.webm` file provides a visual demonstration of the script in action. You can open this file using any media player that supports the `.webm` format.
